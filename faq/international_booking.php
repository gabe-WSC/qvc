<div style="background-color:#b8b8b8; color:white; padding:20px; font-size:22px; line-height:150%; text-align: left;">Who can I phone to make an international booking?</div>
<p style="padding:20px 20px 20px 20px;">You can contact RCI International or DAE directly and they will be able to help you with International availability. ACT Travel can assist you with your travel arrangements once your international booking has been confirmed. Please refer to our contact page for contact information.</p>

<div style="background-color:#b8b8b8; color:white; padding:20px; font-size:22px; line-height:150%; text-align: left;">Why do I have to deal with RCI or DAE and not QVC when making my international booking?</div>
<p style="padding:20px 20px 20px 20px;">As your QVC International holidays are secured through RCI / DAE, we have determined that your international requests are most effectively managed when handled directly by them. This alleviates unnecessary communications through an intermediary party and provides you with an efficient and straightforward international booking service. We therefore kindly request that you contact RCI / DAE directly with regards to international requests and advise the consultant that you are a QVC member. Please refer to our contact page for contact information.</p>
