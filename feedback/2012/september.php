<div class="feedbackWhite">I would like to commend one of your employees excellent service delivery to me over the last 2 weeks. Cath Hoy assisted me in sorting out my Quality Vacation Club query and questions I had. Now under normal circumstances that would have been very good already seeing that when I lived in South Africa I have had so many frustrations with the administrative side of my QVC portfolio. What makes Cath's service so extraordinary is the fact that I live in Australia now and this whole query was handled between different time zones, e-mails and late night/early morning phone calls. Cath went absolutely out of her way to assist me in understanding my entitlements and available options being a QVC club member. Cath did what few others would do and made contact with other companies on my behalf and got things sorted. The final outcome is that I can now utilize my QVC points in Australia. I believe I will now, for the first time in 6 years since I purchased the portfolio, be able to enjoy the benefits of this opportunity. All thanks to Cath. I don't know what you will do with this "thank you" but please let Cath know I really appreciate her help and assistance. - Drikus Scheepers</div>
