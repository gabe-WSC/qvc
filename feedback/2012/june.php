<div class="feedbackWhite">Emmanual, Thank you very much for your patience and keeping your commitment to get back to me as promised, in assisting me with this matter. I think that you are a star and people like you make QVC a nice club. Now you have two happy members, me and someone else who will benefit from being able to use the week that I cancelled. Well done and thank you very much. Kind regards - Krish Pillay</div>
