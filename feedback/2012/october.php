<div class="feedbackGrey">I would also like to make use of this opportunity to thank QVC Management and staff for their dedicated support, help and assistance through the years to make our holidays happy, exciting and enjoyable. If we look back today, the QVC Holiday Club Investment, was one of the best investments we ever made on the the 24th April 1995. We only have superb pleasing memories from all the Resorts where we have spend holidays and break a ways. The Resorts varied from 5 star to 3 star, yet the service provided by the Management and staff, always remained 5 star. The service of staff, from all the resorts were commendable and exceeded all expectations, hence the success of QVC Holiday Club. We as a family are proud to be members of a Holiday Club such as QVC. The N.umber 1 Points/ Bonus Holiday Club Resort in South Africa. Fondest regards and blessings - Frans Olivier</div>
