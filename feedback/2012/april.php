<div class="feedbackWhite">The Manager. Member Services / Care. On 28 March 2012, short notice, I phoned and spoke to Jonathan and requested him to help me find accommodation nearby Pretoria. My wife had a feet reconstruction surgery and the plaster of Paris were removed just before the weekend. She still could only walk max 50 meters. We also could not take her very far with the feet hanging down, ie. driving in a car even on pillows. Jonathan found us accommodation at Ukuthula Lodge. Rooiberg, breakfast and dinner included, which was absolutely fantastic in our current situation. We could ask for nothing better.
A great big thank you to Jonathan, we really appreciate his efforts in doing his utmost to help us as members of QVC. QVC is the best. points holiday club/organization by far. But this achievement is
only possible through loyal and dedicated staff members like Jonathan. Please hand Jonathan a copy of this email. Your kindness will be very much appreciated. Kind regards - Frans G Olivier And Dirk Olivier</div>

<div class="feedbackGrey">Good day Sir, Thank you very much for the way in which you assisted me and for the useful information which was mailed to me. Kind regards. - Wilma Boltman</div>
