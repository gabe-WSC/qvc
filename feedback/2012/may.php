<div class="feedbackGrey">Dear Jonathan, Thank-you for the professional manner in which you handled this issue, please could you forward this email to your superiors as they should know when they have a professional they need to look after. - Sean Kinsey</div>

<div class="feedbackWhite">I must say that I am really and truly grateful to Terence for the efficient assistance that he gave to me today. I have a dilemma in that my Dad who is 78 years old wants to go to Durban because he does so every year. He cannot drive himself. I could not get a booking for all of my family members so I was still in the process of deciding who would have to stay behind. Not a pleasant task or one I was looking forward to. I can now truly look forward to my holiday because of Terence and the wonderful job he's done- in true QVC style. THANK YOU- TERENCE NEWTON - Rajni Ramdin</div>

May God Sincerely Bless You. Much Regards - Denise Bandlow</div>
