<h1 class="grey pl-3 pl-md-3 pl-lg-3" >JULY 2013<br/>MEMBER FEEDBACK</h1>

<div class="feedbackGrey">...when I have doubts or questions I have in the past phoned the call centre, who has provided friendly, prompt service and in so doing I have had some amazing trouble-free, getaways especially with my family from Portugal who hadn't visited SA for 15 years. We had an unforgettable experience and wholesome, fun family time at Ngwenya Lodge and had the most incredible privilege of seeing some spectacular wildlife on our booked game drives.  I will definitely use the tools available from QVC and its partners to make this a more regular part of our lives.  Thanks QVC!!! and the people at the call centre for making it really easy for me to understand and make it happen. - Lidia Guimaraes</div>

<div class="feedbackWhite">I purchased my points in about 1998 after having a few promotional freebies at Crystal Springs and Ngwenya lodge. Since then I have had many holidays with my sons and more recently with my partner at the same places and in Kwazulu -Natal. Many of these breaks were used at a time of great financial strain and more recently joyful breaks.<br /><br />
There is no way I could have so many thrilling and enjoyable breaks away if I had not invested in QVC points membership, Regards, - Anthony Bass</div>

<div class="feedbackGrey">Dear QVC,
It is a joy for us to belong to the club and this new idea of yours will , I am sure, bring amazing results!
 
For interest. I won a week of timeshare when QVC first started, and we bought an adjoining week at that time. In fact my Winklespruit certificate is dated 1993. We did not use this timeshare very much as the holiday fell within the budget time of my husband's job. He was an accountant. Sometime later QVC contacted us and offered to exchange our weeks for points and at the same time we bought more points. This opened a whole new world to us. Since then we have used our points to their best advantage. At least we think so. We have exchanged for overseas holidays ourselves. We have given holidays as wedding presents to our Son and two nephews. One spent time in Hawaii, one in the Black Forest in Germany and one in at a Tree Lodge in Zimbabwe. Now we are retired and we spend a mid-week, once a month if we can, out of season and at some or other resort. We are the envy of the residents here in our retirement complex. We have our favourite places to go to, of course, but we try out new places nearly every month or so. What makes this possible, is the fact that our local exchanges are covered by our levies and we don't have to pay extra for each holiday we book. As pensioners we are no longer financially able to book overseas holidays, but local is great!<br /><br /> 
I am 71 and my husband is 75 and we have been members almost as long as QVC has been going. Perhaps we are the oldest, longest membership people in the Club????<br /><br /> 
We could book on line, but as we live on Atterbury Road, it is just a hop and a skip to the offices and we LOVE sitting with a live person and finding places to go. Usually we book six months at a time.<br /><br /> 
We love the Club and feel that at our age, we are as "fit" as we can get.
Thanks QVC, it is a great club to belong to. Blessings, - Margie Martin</div>

<div class="feedbackWhite">I always enjoy the weekly newsletter from Tradeuinpoint.co.za and in the newsletter dated 26 June 2013 they advertised a couple of timeshare units for R1099.00 for a week as last minute bookings at Eagle Nest and GRC Island. My son and his family were looking for a holiday and I wasn't able to help them with any points for a holiday, but I was able to forward this very special offer to them.  No doubt they took up the offer without hesitation and I am most grateful to Tradeunipoint.co.za for giving away such weeks.<br /><br />
QVC is the most wonderful company and although we have never been able to purchase any additional points with QVC as now my husband and I are pensioners, we have thoroughly enjoyed all our holidays and the many places we have visited with our points with QVC. - Dennis and Avril Stevens</div>
