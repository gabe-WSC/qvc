<div class="feedbackGrey">It was my birthday on Sunday 26 May 2013, whereby I turned 62 years old.  We are QVC-members and through them we win a weekend (Presentation 2012).  We kept it for as long to try to use it May 2013. After a good search the offices of QVC gave us our choice – MONATENG Chalets in the Northern Province.<br /><br />
My husband and myself stayed from Friday afternoon till Monday morning 04:00 and went to work from there – only an hours drive.  What a weekend and what a beautiful place this MONATENG is!<br /><br />
A beautiful well-equipped chalet, well-looked after gardens and swimming pool area.  Animals like the Eland and Nyala were part of the surroundings.  An Ostrich, friendly house cats, beautiful birds, the hippos, the howl of the jackals at dusk and night time.  For my birthday we booked at the Restaurant and what a lovely 3-course meal for R99,50 coffee included.  We could take a walk everyday without fear, what a pleasure!<br /><br />
Thank you Monateng, we will surely get back to you. - Marie Ras</div>
