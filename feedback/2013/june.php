<div class="feedbackGrey">Goeiemiddag Chanel, Wat 'n fees was Bakunung nie verlede week nie!!! Dit was wonderlik om elke dag daar tussen die diere, voëls en in die pragtige natuurskoon te kon ry. Ons het werklik uitstekende fotos kon neem en wil graag daarvan by die kompetisie indien. Daar was die ongelooflike "padblokkade" waar 6 olifante, en 'n kleintjie tussen hulle, in die middel van die teerpad voor alle verkeer gaan staan het. Dit was asemnemend mooi. Ons het ook 'n klein renostertjie sien drink aan sy ma, en dit net direk hier langs die  pad waar ons gestaan het. Daar was glo twee leeus wat mens net deur die verkyker kon sien maar dit was te ver. Intussen het 'n yslike seekoei egter vir ons 'n pragtige vertoning in die water gelewer.<br /><br />
Sy het omgerol en in die modderwater baljaar, toe haar geweldige groot bek oopgemaak en die fotos kon geneem word!! Daar was soveel mooi dinge en diere om nie eers van die mooi voëls te praat nie! Baie dankie vir jou groot aandeel hierin. Baie, baie dankie Chanel!!!! Hartlike groete en nogmaals baie dankie. - John en Iris Stephens</div>

<div class="feedbackWhite">Just a special thanks for the accommodation at Perna Perna that was organized by Leah Deluca from VRS.<br /><br />
Leah at VRS was very helpful, very friendly and professional and really made it easy for me. Thanks very much. Only a pleasure to work with her. Arriving at Perna Perna I was highly impressed by the friendly and helpful staff (All of them, Management, Reception, Security, Cleaner, etc.), they place was exceptionally clean and neat, nothing out of place, it actually felt as if it was newly renovated but it wasn't. Security was excellent, I felt so safe and at home. Parking was a pleasure and very neat.<br /><br />
I loved the Soup & Sherry, morning tea and cookies, great!! I can highly recommend stay there and I will be back. They even ordered excellent weather! Thanks to everybody at Perna Perna, made me feel like family. Thanks  to Leah at VRS/QVC<br /><br />
Best Regards, - Andre Schoeman</div>

<div class="feedbackGrey">Hi Twanet, We have at last decided on a date for our visit to Kagga Kamma Resort. Would you please make a reservation for me for an 8 sleeper chalet, the nicest chalet with the best view, for the week commencing 6 to 13 September 2013. Thank you for the excellent service in the form of the telephone reminders and the information you have provided me with. Kindly email the relevant reservation confirmation to me. Best regards, - Rob Wood</div>

<div class="feedbackWhite">I herewith would like to thank you for accommodating me on such short notice.

On Sunday 26 May, my brother informed me that his daughter was admitted to ICU at Livingstone hospital in Port Elizabeth.  On Monday morning, we were informed that my niece is critical.  We had to rush to Port Elizabeth not knowing where to stay for the time since we do not have friends or family out there and could not afford to pay for accommodation.  I called your office on Monday at 11:00 and immediately thereafter, a booking was confirmed for a midweek at Sunshine Bay Beach Resort in Jeffreys Bay.<br /><br />
I had to struggle to get my vehicle ready for the long trip, which resulted us in only being able to leave Cap Town at 16:00.  I called the resort to inform them about our late arrival and they arranged for us to collect the keys at the security gate.  We arrived there at 11:00 and was welcomed by the ever so friendly security guard in a most professional way.  We really enjoyed our stay at the resort in spite of the tragic reason for our visit.  In fact, it was a great consolation to know that we could return to our apartment after every visit at the hospital.  The cleanliness and excellent service was a great comfort during our difficult time.<br /><br />
I have learnt that being part of a holiday club does not only serve a purpose for holiday break-aways, but even in times of emergency when you have to be somewhere unplanned, and could not provide for accommodation expenditure. Thank you once again for accommodating us on such short notice.<br /><br />
I would like to thank you, - Wilma Boltman</div>
